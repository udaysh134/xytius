Ofcourse, the bot is not a human being so you can't expect humanly answers and neither it is powered by AI so, you shouldn't also always expect logical answers from it.\n\nAs already mentioned before, this is just for fun, so enjoy it by asking question from which you expect answers like YES or NO or so... You'll probably sometime get some, much astonishing answers.`,
