# Xytius
Welcome to Xytius, an advanced, multi-purpose Discord bot that I developed as a side project in 2021 while learning JavaScript. This bot was designed to enhance Discord servers with a plethora of features, intuitive UI, and seamless integrations with innovative commands and server systems.

‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note : 
Due to a lack of maintenance over the years, Xytius is now only partially operational
at the moment, meaning some of its features work, others don't. However, the codebase
remains intact and serves as a testament to the capabilities and design principles
I implemented during its development.
